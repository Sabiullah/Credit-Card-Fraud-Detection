# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

**Introduction**
The project aimed to predict credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consisted of credit card transactions, highly imbalanced, with 492 frauds among 284,807 transactions. The report explores feature selection, modeling using various classifiers, and evaluates model performance under different sampling techniques.

**Data Overview**
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The data set contains 284807 rows and 31 columns, and found 1081 duplicated rows, after removing all the duplicated rows found the actual data that 473 fraud transactions and 283253 normal transactions.


**Feature Selection:**
- Top Variables for Prediction
Explanation of the most influential variables for predicting fraud, potentially derived from correlation analysis or feature importance.
- PCA Implementation
By doing correlation matrix heatmap found top top features of the class and keep the high featured columns alone with Class and removed rest of the columns from the data set to proceed further modelling.

- Under Sampling
- Over Sampling
